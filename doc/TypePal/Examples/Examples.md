title: Examples of Typecheckers
---
  
#### Synopsis

Examples of type checkers built with TypePal.


#### Description

TypePal is used in a new type checker for the Rascal meta-programming language and also in type checkers for half a dozen
domain-specific languages created by http://swat.engineering in the domains finance, forensics and privacy.

To get you started more quickly, we give below a list of complete TypePal-based type checkers ranging from very simple (intended only to illustrate specific TypePal features) to type checkers for FeatherweightJava and the complete Pascal programming language.
For each example we give a description, the most distinctive TypePal features that are used, and its source at GitHub.
Each example has the same structure:

* `Syntax.rsc` the syntax of the example language.
* `Checker.rsc` the type checker for the language.
* `Test.rsc` functions to call the type checker and test framework.
* `tests.ttl` test cases for the type checker.
* `examples` (optionally) a directory with example.
