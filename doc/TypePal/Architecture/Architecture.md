#### Synopsis

Architectural overview of TypePal

#### Description

Type checking using TypePal proceeds in the following stages:

* _Parse_ the program to be analyzed using its syntax definition, the result is a parse tree;
* _Collect_ constraints (facts, calculators, and requirements) from the parsed program and build an initial `TModel` 
  using these collected constraints;
* _Solve_ the constraints, the result is a validated and further enriched `TModel`. 
  This amounts to executing calculators and requirements when the types on which they depend become available. 
  This also involves resolving the semantic links between program parts as introduced by, e.g., import statements.

This approach is very flexible, since each of the stages can be called separately, enabeling a pipeline with 
user-defined model transformations inbetween.

This whole process starts with a syntax for the language we want to analyze (let's call that language _L_ for now). 
The _L_ syntax is used to parse the _L_ program we want to type check. The result is a parse tree.

Collecting constraints from the resulting parse tree is based on the builder pattern:
first a new ((Collector)) is created (using `newCollector`) and that enables the author of the type checker
to add facts, requirements and calculators to the `TModel` depending on the specific input program.
The Collector calls user-defined `collect` functions for each language construct.
This collection process is strictly _local_ and based
on the nested structure of the parse tree and the result is an initial `TModel`.

After the Collector phase, a `TModel` is available whose constraints can be solved (or not).
This is done by creating a new ((Solver)) (using `newSolver`) and running it on the given `TModel`.

TypePal can be configured using a ((TypePal Configuration)).
